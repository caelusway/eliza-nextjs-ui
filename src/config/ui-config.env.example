NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_PREVIEW_SLIDES=How do DNA methylation clocks relate to biological aging?|DNA methylation clocks are powerful biomarkers that measure biological age by analyzing methylation patterns at specific CpG sites. The Horvath clock uses 353 CpG sites and correlates strongly with chronological age.;What are the main goals of the RMR2 project?|The Robust Mouse Rejuvenation 2 project aims to double the remaining lifespan of middle-aged mice through combination interventions like cellular reprogramming and senolytic drugs.;Are dasatinib and quercetin effective senolytics?|Yes, the dasatinib + quercetin combination is one of the most validated senolytic interventions. In mice, it extends healthspan and reduces senescent cell burden by 30-70%.;Rapamycin vs metformin for longevity - which is better?|Rapamycin shows stronger evidence for lifespan extension, consistently extending median lifespan by 10-15% in mice when started late in life via mTOR inhibition.
